## Tutorial resouses
Title : "Vanilla JS Number Facts App - Ajax & Fetch"
Channel/creator: "Traversy Media"

This site was made following a youtube tutorial series.
Assets were received from the tutorial's github repo and all their rights rights reserved.

## my modifications
Part of my learning strategy is to not blindly copy/follow along tutorial series projects.
I always try to add or modify at least one thing in the project.

List of my changes.
*added a "random number" button that randomly selects a number up to 1000.
*used git branching work flow to add additional features such as getting facts about dates.
